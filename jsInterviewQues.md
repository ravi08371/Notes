<h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages. It is a client-side scripting language, which means that it is executed by the user's web browser rather than on a server. JavaScript is often used in combination with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, the `==` operator is used to compare the value of two operands, while the `===` operator is used to compare the value and the type of two operands. For example:
In the example , x == y returns true because the values of x and y are equal, even though they are of different types. However, x === y returns false because the values and types of x and y are not equal.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, `==` is the equality operator and `===` is the strict equality operator. The difference between the two is that `==` performs type coercion, which means that it converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison. `===`, on the other hand, does not perform type coercion, so it only returns true if the operands are of the same type and have the same value.</p>



```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = '5';

console.log(x == y); // Output: true
console.log(x === y); // Output: false
```

<h2>What is a callback function in JavaScript?</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the calling function has completed. Callback functions are often used in asynchronous programming, where a function is called and the results are not immediately available. The callback function is executed when the results are ready, allowing the program to continue running in the meantime.
For example:In the example, the doSomething function takes a callback function as an argument. When the action has completed, the callback function is called. In this case, the callback function logs a message to the console.</p>


```javascript
function doSomething(callback) {
  // Perform some action
  // ...
  callback();
}

doSomething(function() {
  console.log('The action has completed');
});
```


<h2>What is the difference between JavaScript and Java?</h2>
<p>JavaScript and Java are two different programming languages that have some similarities, but are also quite different. Java is a compiled, object-oriented programming language that is used for building standalone applications and applets. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a scripting language that is used primarily for creating interactive elements on websites. While Java code is compiled and run on the server, JavaScript code is executed directly in the user's web browser.</p>
<h2>What are some of the key features of JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Some of the key features of JavaScript include:
Dynamically-typed: JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime rather than at compile time.

Prototype-based inheritance: JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, which allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.

First-class functions: In JavaScript, functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions.

Asynchronous: JavaScript is an asynchronous language, which means that it is capable of performing tasks in the background while other tasks are being executed. This makes it well-suited for handling tasks that may take a long time to complete, such as making network requests or reading from a large file.</p>


<h2>What is a closure in JavaScript?</h2>
<p>A closure in JavaScript is a function that has access to the variables and arguments of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned. Closures are created whenever a function is defined inside another function, and they allow the inner function to retain access to the variables and arguments of the outer function even after the outer function has completed its execution.
For example:In this example, the innerFunction has access to the x variable of the outerFunction, even after the outerFunction has returned. This is because the innerFunction is a closure that captures the x variable of the outerFunction.</p>


```javascript
function outerFunction(x) {
  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(x);
  }
  return innerFunction;
}

const foo = outerFunction(10);
foo(); // logs 10
```


<h2>What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?</h2>
<p>An anonymous function in JavaScript is a function that does not have a name. Anonymous functions are often used as arguments to other functions, or as values that are immediately passed to other functions.
For example:</p>


```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}, 1000);
```

<p>In this example, the anonymous function function() { console.log('Hello, world!'); } is being passed as an argument to the setTimeout function, which will execute the anonymous function after a delay of 1000 milliseconds.

Anonymous functions can also be assigned to variables, in which case they are often referred to as "function expressions":</p>


```javascript
const sayHello = function() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
};

sayHello(); // logs 'Hello, world!'
```


<p>Anonymous functions can be useful in situations where a function is only needed for a short period of time, or where the function is only needed in a specific context.</p>
<h2>What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in JavaScript?</h2>
<p>The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is executing the current function. In the global scope (i.e., outside of any function), `this` refers to the global object (e.g., `window` in the browser). Within a function, `this` refers to the object that is calling the function.
The value of this can be manipulated using the call, apply, and bind methods. These methods allow you to specify the object that should be treated as this when the function is executed.

For example:In this example, the sayHello function is called with the obj object as the this value. As a result, this.name inside the sayHello function refers to obj.name, which is 'John'.</p>


```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
}

const obj = { name: 'John' };
sayHello.call(obj); // logs 'Hello, John!'
```


<h2>What is a promise in JavaScript?</h2>
<p>A promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation. Promises are used to handle the potential delays that can occur when making network requests or performing other asynchronous tasks.
A promise has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. When a promise is first created, it is in the pending state. If the asynchronous operation completes successfully, the promise is fulfilled and the resulting value is returned. If the operation fails, the promise is rejected and an error is thrown.

Promises can be used to simplify the process of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. For example:In this example, the fetch function returns a promise that is fulfilled with the response from the server. The then method is used to specify a callback that should be executed when the promise is fulfilled, and the catch method is used to specify a callback that should be executed if the promise is rejected. This allows you to write asynchronous code that is easy to read and maintain.</p>


```javascript
fetch('/data.json')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```


<h2>What is hoisting in JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Hoisting is a term used in JavaScript to describe the behavior of variable declarations. When a variable is declared using the `var` keyword, it is automatically moved to the top of its scope (i.e., the nearest enclosing function or block). This means that the variable can be used before it is declared.</p>
<h2>What is a pure function in JavaScript?</h2>
<p>A pure function in JavaScript is a function that has the following properties:
It does not have any side effects, which means that it does not modify any variables or objects outside of its own scope.
It always returns the same output for a given set of inputs.
It does not depend on any external state or variables.
Pure functions are considered to be a good practice in functional programming, as they are easy to test and debug, and they do not have unintended consequences.

For example:</p>


```javascript
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

<p>The add function is a pure function, as it does not have any side effects, it always returns the same output for a given set of inputs, and it does not depend on any external state or variables.

On the other hand, the following function is not pure, as it has a side effect (it modifies the counter variable) and it depends on an external variable (counter):</p>


```javascript
let counter = 0;
function increment() {
  counter++;
  return counter;
}
```


<p>It is generally recommended to use pure functions as much as possible, as they can make your code easier to understand and maintain.</p>

<h2>What is the difference between an object and an array in JavaScript?</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs, while an array is an ordered list of elements.

Here are some key differences between objects and arrays in JavaScript:

Syntax: Objects are defined using curly braces {}, and the key-value pairs are separated by a colon. Arrays are defined using square brackets [].

Property access: You can access the properties of an object using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object['property']). Array elements are accessed using their index number in square brackets (array[index]).

Order: Arrays maintain an order to the elements they contain, while the order of the properties in an object is not guaranteed.

Built-in methods: Arrays have a number of built-in methods for manipulating their elements, such as push(), pop(), and shift(). Objects do not have these built-in methods, but you can add your own methods to objects using the object's prototype.</p>

<h2>How do you handle errors in JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Try-catch statements: You can use a try-catch statement to catch and handle errors that occur in a block of code. The try block contains the code that may throw an error, and the catch block contains the code to handle the error. For example:</p>


```javascript
try {
  // code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // code to handle the error
}
```

<p>Throwing errors: You can throw your own errors using the throw statement. This is useful when you want to throw an error from a function if a certain condition is not met. For example:</p>

```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error('Cannot divide by 0');
  }
  return a / b;
}
```

<p>Using the onerror event: You can use the onerror event to handle errors that occur in your JavaScript code. The onerror event is triggered when an error occurs and allows you to specify a function to run when the event occurs. For example:</p>

```javascript
window.onerror = function(error) {
  // code to handle the error
}
```
